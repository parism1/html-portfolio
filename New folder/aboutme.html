<p> My Name is Muhammed Adeniji Adeyemi. <br>

        Then after Graduating from the school, i then movevd to a nearby secondary 
        school of the name " Ilorin Comprehnsive High School".</p>
        Here, i read my Jsss1 to Jss2 classes there, then due to the relocation, 
        i had to switch to another school that was closer to our new house. <br>
         Althoough, i didn't stay long at the school before i moved back to my previous
          secondary school.</p>
After my ,ss2 Program i switched my School to Ita-Alamu Community High School where i
 obtained my Senior WAEC Certificate.
